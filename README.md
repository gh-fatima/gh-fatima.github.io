# About Me

Welcome to my homepage! I am Fatemeh Ghofrani, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of South Carolina. My journey in machine learning began during my M.Sc. at Shiraz University of Technology, where I explored methods for automating medical X-ray image classification, proposing efficient Gabor-based CS-local binary patterns, and fuzzy-based classifiers. Later, I delved into Internet traffic data analysis, addressing challenges in traffic classification. I contributed by using Bayesian networks and introducing a new decomposable model for modeling internet traffic data. Currently, at the University of South Carolina, I'm focused on developing robust and high-performance machine learning algorithms, with a keen interest in representation learning, adversarial robustness, and explainability in ML. Excited to contribute to the world of machine learning, I aim to create innovative solutions for various challenges.
