### About Me
Welcome to my homepage! I'm Fatemeh Ghofrani, a Ph.D. student in computer science at University of South Carolina.
<br>
During my M.Sc. at Shiraz University of Technology, I specialized in automating medical X-ray image classification. I explored techniques like Gabor-based CS-local binary patterns and fuzzy-based classifiers.
<br>
Moving on, I shifted my focus to Internet traffic data analysis, contributing to the field with Bayesian networks and a decomposable model.
<br>
Currently, my work centers around developing robust machine learning algorithms. I'm particularly interested in representation learning, adversarial robustness, and AI explainability for deep learning. You can find my publications on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NWOeb_AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" style="color: green;">Google Scholar</a>.
