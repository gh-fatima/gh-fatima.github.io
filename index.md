### About Me
Welcome to my homepage! I am Fatemeh Ghofrani, a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of South Carolina. My journey in machine learning started during my M.Sc. at Shiraz University of Technology, where I focused on automating medical X-ray image classification using innovative methods like Gabor-based CS-local binary patterns and fuzzy-based classifiers. Later, I delved into Internet traffic data analysis, contributing to the field with Bayesian networks and a novel decomposable model. Currently, I am dedicated to developing robust machine learning algorithms, with a strong interest in representation learning, adversarial robustness, and explainability.
